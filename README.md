# Data Engineering with Microsoft Azure
We delve into the the Tokyo Olympics dataset from Kaggle using the robust capabilities of Microsoft Azure's cloud platform. This project is designed to showcase the integration and analytical power of Azure Services, including 
**Azure Data Factory**, **Data Lake Gen2**, **Databricks**, and **Synapse Analytics**.
Our goal is to provide insights into the Tokyo Olympics dataset, utilizing Azure for data engineering tasks.

Project Overview
The Tokyo Olympics dataset provides a comprehensive look at the athletes, events, and results from the games. Our project utilizes a series of Microsoft Azure services to extract, transform, load (ETL), and analyze this data, presenting findings that offer a deeper understanding of the dataset through the lens of Azure's cloud technology.

## Services Used
1. Azure Data Factory: Orchestrates the data flow from the source to the data lake, ensuring seamless data ingestion.
2. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: Acts as our centralized repository for storing the raw and processed data, offering scalable and secure data storage.
3. Azure Databricks: Provides a collaborative platform for data exploration and analysis, leveraging Apache Spark for fast data processing.
4. Azure Synapse Analytics: Integrates big data and data warehousing for comprehensive analytics solutions, enabling us to derive meaningful insights from our dataset.
   
##  Getting Started
To replicate or build upon our project, you'll need access to the Microsoft Azure platform and the Tokyo Olympics dataset from Kaggle. Follow these steps to set up the environment and explore the dataset:

* Set up Azure Services: Create instances of Azure Data Factory, Data Lake Gen2, Databricks, and Synapse Analytics in your Azure portal.
* Data Ingestion: Use Azure Data Factory to ingest the dataset from Kaggle into Azure Data Lake Gen2.
* Data Processing: Analyze and process the data using Azure Databricks, creating notebooks for different analytical queries.
* Data Analysis and Reporting: Utilize Azure Synapse Analytics to compile, analyze, and report on the findings derived from the Databricks notebooks.
